# Photolabs

PhotoLabs is a React-based single-page application (SPA) designed to provide users with a seamless experience for viewing stock photos in different contexts. It allows users to browse, explore, and interact with photos in an organized and intuitive manner.

This project is built in four key phases, each focusing on progressively implementing React concepts and integrating API data.


## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install` in each respective `/frontend` and `/backend`.

## [Frontend] Running Webpack Development Server

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

## [Backend] Running Backend Servier

Read `backend/readme` for further setup details.

```sh
cd backend
npm start
```

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Create React App (CRA), SCSS
- **Backend**: Express (for the API server)
- **State Management**: React Context API, useState, useReducer
- **API**: Custom API for fetching photo data (RESTful)


## Features

- **Browse Photos**: View high-quality stock photos from various categories.
- **Favorite Photos**: Mark photos as favorites for easy access later.
- **Photographer Info**: Display details about the photographer, including name and location.

## Phases of Development

The project is built in four main phases:

- **Component Isolation**: Build the smallest reusable components first (e.g., buttons, list items) and progress up to more complex components.
- **State Management**: Utilize React's useState and useReducer hooks for managing state within components.
- **API Integration**: Fetch and display data from the custom API, including photos and photographer information.
- **Advanced React Patterns**: Implement advanced patterns to handle state efficiently and add live updates as the application changes.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts, save favorites, and upload photos.
- **Search Functionality**: Add a search bar to allow users to filter photos by keywords.
- **Photo Categorization**: Tag and categorize photos for easier browsing.
- **Photo Editing**: Enable users to apply filters and edit photos within the app.
